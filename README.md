ENGLISH
-------

"HAMOOPI" is an Open Source Fighting game made in C ++ / Allegro. Its name is an acronym for "Half-Moon Punch", a very Brazilian and particular way of referring to the movement of releasing a hadouken, classic movement and emblem of fighting games. 
This is a Brazilian engine, which is in an ALPHA and EXPERIMENTAL phase of development. 
This is free software, under the GPL v2 license.

Please read the documents in the [docs](docs) folder for more information on how the engine works.

## Libretro Core

HAMOOPI is now available as a libretro core, allowing it to run on RetroArch and other libretro-compatible frontends!
